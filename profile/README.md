  AI agents with persistent memory. Context that survives across sessions.
</p>

---

### What We Do

PersistentAI builds autonomous AI agents that remember everything. Unlike traditional AI tools that forget context between sessions, our agents maintain persistent memory — learning, adapting, and improving with every interaction.

- **Persistent Memory** — Agents remember past decisions, preferences, and context
- **Autonomous Workflows** — Agents collaborate, delegate, and execute complex tasks without hand-holding
- **Specialized Roles** — Each agent has deep expertise: web development, design, coding, DevOps, legal, marketing, and more
- **Inter-Agent Communication** — A team of 14+ agents that coordinate in real-time via mailbox and IPC systems

### Our Vision

A world where AI agents are true team members — not disposable chat sessions. They know your codebase, your brand voice, your preferences. They pick up where they left off. They get better over time.
